Make sure all files are in the same folder. 

use any c++ software to open main.cpp and run.

I used CLion and just run main.cpp

Or you can compile in terminal using g++ with c++11 clang to avoid the "auto" warning/compile issue

Then you can run the file that you produce.

g++ -std=c++11 your_file.cpp -o your_program
